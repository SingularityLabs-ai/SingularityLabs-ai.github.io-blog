Issue | Details
-|-
LLMs lack episodic memory | Episodic memory is a system between working and long-term memory. LLMs can use long context windows like extended working memory but it's not ideal.
LLMs' ethical reasoning is limited | Ideally they should reason through consequences of actions and pick the best option. Currently they just provide the first response without real consideration. RLHF and Constitutional AI can help but are not robust.
LLMs lack creativity | They can mix concepts but not true creativity which involves possibility searching. They cannot exhibit true creative thought.
Hutter's 2025 prediction for AGI | In 2009, he predicted human-level AGI by 2025 based on Kurzweil's idea that data and compute were growing exponentially. Extrapolating trends, he estimated AI would have human-level data exposure by 2025.
Problems with AIXI formalism | The AIXI approach to formalizing AI has issues - the "reference Turing machine" parameter is undefined and Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable and difficult to approximate. 
Next major advancement is multimodality | Legg predicts future models will be seen as limited by just processing text/chat, while future models will incorporate multiple modalities like vision, audio etc.
